This script is a beginner script designed to provide basic encryption skills and knowledge to newcomers in Python encryption. 
It is designed to encrypt a string using a randomly generated key utilizing a static salt. 
A message is encrypted through the cipher utilizing this encryption key and is then decrypted by the same program, printing the original message while also providing a binary file with the encrypted message.

!! THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED FOR PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES AS IT IS A RELATIVELY INSECURE ENCRYPTION METHOD DUE TO THE STATIC ELEMENTS WITHIN IT !!
